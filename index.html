    <h4>Why UX?</h4>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Shadows+Into+Light&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <p>I am a UX / UI Designer with a Background in Business Management. I started my professional career in the hospitality industry, more specifically restaurant management. After 7 years of building my expertise in customer service, I decided to pivot my career and use my existing skills in understanding customer needs and wants along with build new skillsets in UX / UI Design.
